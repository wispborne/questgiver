# Questgiver

A wrapper for Starsector's (v0.95.1a) common quest-related classes.

Your mod must be written in Kotlin to use this library in anything approaching a reasonable manner.

## Usage

See Persean Chronicles (https://github.com/wispborne/stories/tree/dev) or DM me on Discord.

This is not written to be used by other people and maintaining documentation would take time away from modding. 
However, feel free to grab any code from it that you want; there are a number of useful methods in `wispLib` that are unrelated to quests. I've used the Unlicense, which means you can do anything with it at all (unless it's noted that it's adapted from a different developer).

## Credits

- Sundog: `wisp.questgiver.wispLib.CrashReporter` is based on Starship Legends code.
- LazyWizard: For LazyLib as well as some code in Console Commands (the string autocorrection code).
- Easing code translated from the Java source at <https://github.com/mattdesl/cisc226game>.
